	** to create a middleware 
		
		** php artisan make:middleware Admin
		** after creating the middleware we need to register it on
		   >APP\HTTP\REQUEST\KERNEL.PHP
		** this is to check wheter the user is active or not (if the user is 		allowed to access the admin page)

	** to validate and avoid going in directly into a route wihtout logging in 
		use a middleware on routes for the whole routing process , use 'AUTH'
